<section class="about container">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Azwar Muhammad Aslam is a Research Associate at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in the Centre for Governance, Markets and Regulatory Analysis (CGMRA), holding an MPhil in Economics and Finance (Gold Medalist). His research sits at the intersection of markets, regulations, and law & economics, with a particular focus on urban land markets, property rights, real estate, public land utilization, and the gig economy.</p>

    <p>Azwar has led and contributed to grant-funded research projects, including a PKR 2.5 million study on unlocking Pakistan Railways’ “dead capital,” and has produced groundbreaking work on state-captured land—research that was acknowledged by Pakistan’s highest policy-making forum, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). He played a central role in national reform initiatives such as the Reform Agenda for Export Diversification and the PIDE Reform Manifesto. His work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, flagship policy reports, and widely read opinion pieces in leading newspapers, influencing debates on regulatory efficiency, market reforms, and state asset utilization.</p>

    <p>In addition to his research, Azwar has delivered technical trainings, including a 3-day executive course on CGE/GTAP modelling for senior officials from the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the World Bank and Infisum Modeling (USA). His portfolio spans legal and economic analysis, market diagnostics, and policy design—providing evidence-based solutions that address regulatory bottlenecks, improve market functioning, and strengthen governance.</p>

    <p>With a proven ability to connect rigorous analysis to practical reforms, Azwar’s expertise is sought by government taskforces, reform committees, and development partners aiming to bridge the policy–research gap and advance Pakistan’s economic development agenda.</p>

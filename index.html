<section id="about">
  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a Research Associate at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in the Centre for Governance, Markets and Regulatory Analysis (CGMRA), with an MPhil in Economics and Finance (Gold Medalist). My work lies at the intersection of markets, regulations, and law & economics, with a strong focus on urban land markets, property rights, real estate, public land utilization, and the gig economy.</p>
  <p>I have led and contributed to grant-funded research projects, including a PKR 2.5 million study on unlocking Pakistan Railways’ “dead capital.” My groundbreaking research on state-captured land has been acknowledged by Pakistan’s highest policy-making forum, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). I have also played a central role in national reform initiatives such as the Reform Agenda for Export Diversification and the PIDE Reform Manifesto. My work appears in peer-reviewed journals, flagship policy reports, and leading newspapers, influencing policy debates on regulatory efficiency, market reforms, and state asset utilization.</p>
  <p>Beyond research, I have delivered technical trainings, including a 3-day executive course on CGE/GTAP modelling for senior officials from the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the World Bank and Infisum Modeling (USA). My expertise spans legal and economic analysis, market diagnostics, and policy design—producing evidence-based solutions that tackle regulatory bottlenecks, improve market functioning, and strengthen governance.</p>
  <p>Through this work, I aim to bridge the policy–research gap, translating rigorous economic analysis into practical reforms that strengthen markets, enhance governance, and contribute to Pakistan’s long-term economic development.</p>
